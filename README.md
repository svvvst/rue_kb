# rue_kb

## About
rue_kb is a Rusyn-language keyboard intended for new, anglophone speakers of Rusyn. The layout is meant to provide as familiar an experience as possible to QWERTY keyboard users, while accomodating the larger character set of the Rusyn alphabet.

At this point there is only a Lemko-Rusyn build.

## Installation
* Visit the release page.
* Download the latest `.zip` file.
* Unzip
* Run `setup.exe`

## Usage
### Layout

### "Dead Keys"
This keyboard makes use of the "dead key" feature of Windows' keyboard layouts. A dead key is essentially just one key that alters the output of another. For instance, pressing `` ` `` then `e` might generate `Ã¨`.
This feature is employed in rue_kb to allow the 30+ letters of the Rusyn alphabets to fit on a standard keyboard.
